## 🎮 About This Project

**Ninja Dennis** is a 2D tile-based game created as part of the **42 School curriculum's "So Long" project**. The project name pays homage to Douglas Adams' famous book *"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"*, where dolphins leave Earth with the message "So long, and thanks for all the fish!" - much like our ninja hero must collect all items and escape the level.

This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts including:
- 2D graphics rendering with **MiniLibX**
- Event handling (keyboard input)
- Collision detection
- Enemy sprites with patrol patterns
- Real-time gameplay mechanics

## 🥷 Game Story

**Dennis the Ninja menace** has made landfall on the shores of a Viking settlement! This crafty warrior has discovered that the fierce Viking women have stockpiled the finest fish in their coastal strongholds. With his insatiable appetite for adventure (and seafood), Dennis must infiltrate their fortified compounds, swiftly collect all the precious fish before the Viking warriors detect his presence, and escape through the ancient underground tunnel networks that connect the settlements.

But beware! The Viking women are not mere fishmongers - they are battle-hardened defenders who patrol their territories with deadly precision. Dennis must use all his ninja skills to avoid their wrath, strike when necessary, and vanish into the shadows before reinforcements arrive. The underground tunnels offer his only hope of escape, but they will only open once he has claimed every last fish from their stores!

Will Dennis successfully complete his fishy heist and disappear into the underground labyrinth, or will he become another cautionary tale whispered around Viking campfires? The fate of this ninja menace lies in your hands!

*Navigate Dennis through Viking settlements, collect all the fish (C), avoid or defeat the patrolling Viking women (B), and escape through the underground tunnel exits (E) before your stealth runs out!*

## 🌟 Why "So Long"?

The project name **"So Long"** is a reference to Douglas Adams' *"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"*, where dolphins—being the second most intelligent species on Earth—leave the planet just before its destruction with the parting message:

> **"So long, and thanks for all the fish!"**

In our game, like the dolphins' escape, Dennis must collect everything valuable and make his escape before it's too late. The title reminds us that sometimes the smartest move is knowing when to leave—after collecting what matters, of course! 🐬

This literary reference adds a touch of humor and philosophical depth to what might otherwise be "just another escape game."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game won't compile:**
```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install gcc make libx11-dev libxext-dev libbsd-dev

# Rebuild
make fclean && make
```
